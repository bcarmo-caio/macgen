I don't know what to put here yet because I have copied code from Wikipedia
and I also use Levenshtein which is GPL, but just call it... Don't know...
Once I know what to do, I fix this thing.

If you know how can I fix this, please tell me. I just would like to be able
to be complient to Debian (without using non-free sources)
